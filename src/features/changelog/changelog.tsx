    title: 'Introduce "Loadouts", replacing "Gear sets"',
    description: (
      <>
        <Typography gutterBottom>
          This is similar to the newly introduced feature in-game where you can
          save your weapon preset + equipment (gear) preset etc. together and
          change them all at once. There is no in-game name for this so I will
          be calling it &quot;Loadouts&quot;. The previous &quot;Gear sets&quot;
          page has now been replaced by &quot;Loadouts&quot; page, where you can
          set weapons/matrices, equipment (gear), the main element type for that
          loadout, and the stats for that element type altogether.
        </Typography>
        <Typography gutterBottom>
          There is a default loadout for each element (Flame, Frost, Physical,
          Volt). In the Gear Comparer page, you now choose a loadout as the
          basis for comparison.{" "}
          <b>
            Any changes you do in the Gear Comparer page (to the weapons, gear
            etc.) will be saved to that loadout.
          </b>
        </Typography>
        <Typography gutterBottom>
          I am planning to work on an easier way to import a loadout from the
          game in the future, maybe as a separate &quot;scanner&quot;
          application that exports your inventory from the game

        <Typography gutterBottom>
          Can now change a piece of gear into the titan type of that gear. After
          that, for each random stat, you can then adjust the value increase you
          get from augmenting and the total value{" "}
          <i>(Base value (at 5-star) + increase = total value)</i>. The
          gear&apos;s value% is then calculated from the total value for each
          stat.
        </Typography>
        <Typography gutterBottom>
          If your gear is only &quot;augmented&quot; and not a &quot;titan&quot;
          gear yet, you can still use this also. Augmented gear and Titan gear
          are treated the same here.
